# Do It Now 

### Summary
- Rite-of-passage first exercise working with an MV* framework, a single-page to-do app; this, with Backbone framework
- Surprisingly functional, was using it for various purposes, most recently another project's issue list (an early pett.io list)
- Cloud storage is on an Iron Yard heroku site; there's no login, so the data for ths app is open to all
